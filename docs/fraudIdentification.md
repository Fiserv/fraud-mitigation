# Fraud Identification

<pre>Through use of statistical modeling and historical patterns many of the fraud types can be identified and mitigated.</pre>

**ML/AI**

Fraud Mitigation by Carat utilizes the merchant’s data along with powerful consortium fraud networks to understand the
fraudulent activities in detail. This combined approach allows the solution to understand a merchant’s unique fraud (and genuine) patterns, while ensuring that the industry trends are also accommodated.

**Graph Analysis**

To identify fraud patterns and strategies of fraudulent customers, it is important to understand how customers are connected throughout a merchant’s customer base. Moreover, the availability of graph/network connections across a customer portfolio allows to effectively manage false declines. This ensures that genuine customers can complete their orders and prevents merchants from revenue loss.

**Rules / Control**

Rules are also a relevant part of the prevention toolkit. They should be used to stop attacks quickly and to design a fraud prevention strategy based on the merchant’s business goals.

**Device Intelligence**

Device Intelligence is a component of every modern fraud detection solution and is powerful when used in conjunction with advanced machine learning and graph/network analysis. Device Intelligence within a digital commerce fraud prevention platform provides the ability to identify high-risk patterns by using key, hard-to-spoof attributes to identify fraudulent customers.
