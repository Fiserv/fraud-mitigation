---

Learn about the many ways that fraud can occur which puts ecommerce businesses at risk of chargebacks.

---

##### Card testing

Card testing occurs when bad actors attempt to guess the card cvv number through brute force methods. Often using card balance apis to identify if the guessed security codes were correct. Once the card is verified and the security number is confirmed, they will then make additional purchases at the merchant. 

##### Credit card fraud

Since eCommerce transactions are done during the card not present flow, fraudsters will attempt to use another person’s credit card information to make unauthorized purchases.

##### Account takeover

Account takeover occurs when fraudsters break into a legitimate customers online account and steal the stored card information to make purchases. 

##### Friendly fraud

When customers buy items through an ecommerce site and then open a chargeback with the issuer. False claims that their purchase was not received or canceled their order shortly after placing it allow them to obtain goods through nefarious means.

##### Refund fraud

In refund fraud, the fraudster uses stolen credit card credentials to make a purchase, and then reaches out to the store to request a refund. Fraudsters will make an initial excess payment with the stolen card, then request that the refund for the excess amount be sent through a different method as they claim the initial card has now been closed.
